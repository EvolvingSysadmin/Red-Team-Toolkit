The Red Team Toolkit provides tools and techniques for penetration testing. The Red Team Toolkit was made by [@EvolvingSysadmin](https://github.com/evolvingsysadmin). The information is gathered primarily from courses such as those from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). ChatGPT was also used to create and edit content where possible.

In addition to [GitHub](https://github.com/EvolvingSysadmin/Red-Team-Toolkit), the Blue Team Toolkit can be viewed as a GitBook at <https://redteam.ryanheavican.com>.
