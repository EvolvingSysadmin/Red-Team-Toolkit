## Background

[PTES](http://www.pentest-standard.org/) was created by a group of experienced security professionals in response to the lack of a standardized approach to penetration testing. The standard has since become widely adopted and recognized as a valuable resource for organizations and security professionals alike.

## Steps

1. Pre-engagement Interactions: preparation phase including approvals and tools needed for the test
2. Intelligence gathering: information about the target system are gathered from external sources like social media websites, official record, using OSINT and other techniques
3. Threat Modelling: procedure for optimizing network security by identifying objectives and vulnerabilities
4. Vulnerability Analysis: discover and validate vulnerabilities
5. Exploitation: breach the security of the target system using the vulnerabilities previously identified
6. Post Exploitation: maintain control over target system and collect
7. Reporting: Dodocumentcuments entire process in a form understandable to the client
