## Background

The SANS Penetration Testing Framework was developed by the [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/), a leading provider of cybersecurity education and training. The framework was designed to provide a comprehensive and standardized approach to penetration testing that can be used by organizations of all sizes and industries. It draws upon the collective knowledge and experience of SANS instructors and practitioners in the field of cybersecurity.

## Steps

The SANS Penetration Testing Framework includes the following steps:

1. Pre-engagement: Define scope, goals, and rules of engagement for the testing.
2. Intelligence gathering: Gather information about the target environment to identify potential vulnerabilities.
3. Threat modeling: Analyze the information gathered to identify the most likely attack vectors and potential attack scenarios.
4. Vulnerability analysis: Conduct a detailed assessment of the target environment to identify potential vulnerabilities.
5. Exploitation: Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain access to target systems.
6. Post-exploitation: Maintain access to the target environment and escalate privileges.
7. Reporting: Document the findings of the testing process and provide recommendations for remediation.
8. Cleanup: Remove any tools or artifacts left behind during the testing process and restore the environment to its original state.
