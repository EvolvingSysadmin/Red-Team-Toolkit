# Reconnaissance

There are several effective methods for conducting recon for penetration testing:

* [DNS Recon](/reconnaissance/dns-recon.md)
* [Nmap](/reconnaissance/nmap.md)
* [OSINT](/reconnaissance/osint.md)
* [Web Application Recon](/reconnaissance/web-application-recon.md)
* Vulnerability scanning

Reconnaissance, both passive and active, is a crucial phase in penetration testing as it helps the tester understand the target system's architecture, identify potential vulnerabilities, and design a more effective attack strategy.
